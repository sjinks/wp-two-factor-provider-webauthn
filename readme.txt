WebAuthn authentication provider for Two Factor plugin.

== Description ==

This plugin adds support for WebAuthn into the [Two Factor](https://wordpress.org/plugins/two-factor/) plugin.

Because the U2F API [is deprecated and will be removed in February 2022](https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/g/blink-dev/c/xHC3AtU_65A/m/yg20tsVFBAAJ), the plugin enables [seamless support](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7810770/150708968-3c331612-54ad-4373-9d36-6ec064301755.mp4) for the previously registered U2F security keys so that the users don't have to re-register their keys and still be able to log in.
